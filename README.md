Question: 
Consider the database of books maintained in a library system. When a user wants to check whether a particular book is available, a search operations is called for. If the book is available and is issued to the user, a delete operation can be performed to remove this book from the set of available books. When the user returns the book, it can be inserted back into the set of available books. It is essential that we are able to support the above mentioned operations as efficiently as possible as since these operations are performed quite frequently. Formulate the problem and write a C++ program to solve the problem by using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
